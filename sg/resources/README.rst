Description

Glacier is meant for long-term storage of large files/archives. It is a time-consuming process to delete archives and download files. Additionally, you can not delete a Glacier vault container if it still contains archives.

In order to delete a vault, the normal process is:

- Create a job to evaluate the current contents of the vault.
- Wait until the job has been completed (usually three or four hours in us-east).
- Request the job output data.
- Delete each archive listed in the job-output.
- Retrieve inventories until they reflect that there are no archives in the vault.
- Delete the vault.

This can become obnoxious. The goal of this tool is to execute synchronous workflows that just stay running until the job is done.

If something happens and your process is interrupted, you may resume by passing the job-ID::

    sg-vault-delete ACCESSKEY SECRETKEY dustin-test-multi-3 --job-id=76c9jSYmg6k9ZbgxdpZLtRq2kDZML_yzhU_1tEL1f_CgEiXjHyKnnoMTDVFciexsGM82k9X1v9K7T0ms-imt9SvPgPW0

We have only written one tool to solve one problem. PRs will be readily accepted to extend the project with additional tools to execute different workflows.
